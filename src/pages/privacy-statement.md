We value your privacy by giving you complete control over your data.

If you use Weektodo all data is saved on your device locally and is never sent to our server. We do not collect any personal data either.

Weektodo only connects to the internet for the next reasons:

- Get the sponsor data that show up when the app is loading
- Periodically check for new updates
- Send a request to a counter of general daily usage for public statistics
- Send error report in case of error
 
You can disable this features in Settings -> General.

If you request a sponsorship of Weektodo, you will need to provide your email address. We do not share your email address with anybody, and we will only send information related with the sponsorship.
