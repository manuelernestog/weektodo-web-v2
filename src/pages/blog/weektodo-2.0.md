WeekToDo, the Minimalist Task Planner, reaches its version 2. It has been a long journey and after a lot of work we can present you this version full of new features and with an important change in the direction of the project.

## Behavior menu

Now you can manage the behavior of the application from a dedicated settings menu. This allows you to change the workflow in the application and even transform it into a planning system that works by time lines or pending tasks as decided by the user.

## Visual improvements

This new version includes the visualization of tasks in a compact or extended way. The number of columns in the calendar and the custom task lists are also separated, giving the user the freedom to configure the view at will. An optional bookmark is also included for tasks with active notifications.

## GPL-3 license and public project.

Weektodo now uses the GN Public License Version 3 (GPL-3). Unlike the MIT license, the GPL-3 preserves the essence of free software and in the event that any other user creates a copy of the software, they must preserve the open source and under the same license. With this change, the project is committed to community development and both the issues and the kanban of the project are open to anyone who wants to contribute to its development. We hope this has a positive impact on your future and growth.
